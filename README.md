decide to assign you more challenging tasks.

1. Download the data file attached to this assign and connect it to Tableau
2. Create a Top N/Bottom N parameter to show the most popular/least popular products by sales revenue
3. Create a Top N/Bottom N paramter to show the most profitable/least profitable products.
4. Create a parameter to allow the audience quickly view and switch between monthly sales quantity, revenue, and profit of a selected year
